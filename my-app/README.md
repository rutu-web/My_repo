The project has a Navbar with a "Get Users" button which fetches user data from API and displays it in card grid layout. 

API request is made and data is fetched by Asynchonous await. The useState Hook has been used to track state and update when data has been fetched from API.

Material UI has been used for designing Navbar and card component(which displays user information).
